## the tiny vyper helper command

Stupider is smarter is sweeping the globe.
Maybe we will make a tiny tool to help write vyper programs.

We could:
- borrow some verbs from [minihat](https://github.com/nmushegian/minihat)
- use [lockpack](https://github.com/dapphub/lockpack) for package management
- port [ds-test](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-test) for VM level tests
- autogenerate solidity interface definitions for export

Just some ideas.
